# JavaScript and React Interview Preparation

This repository is designed to help you prepare for JavaScript and React technical interviews. It includes a collection of coding exercises, interview questions, and study guides to enhance your understanding of core concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Coding Exercises

This project includes a set of coding exercises to practice JavaScript and React concepts. The exercises are designed to cover a range of topics, including:

- JavaScript fundamentals
- React basics
- State management
- Component lifecycle
- Hooks
- Performance optimization

## Study Guide Files

This project contains two main study guide files to help you prepare for JavaScript and React interviews:

- **GuiaEntrevistaJS.md**

  - A comprehensive JavaScript interview guide (in Spanish and English) covering core concepts, code examples, and exercises. Topics include objects, prototypes, scope, closures, async/await, arrays, OOP, error handling, performance, and more.

- **GuiaEntrevistaReact.md**
  - A detailed React interview guide (in English) covering React fundamentals, hooks, advanced patterns, React internals (Virtual DOM, reconciliation, Fiber), Redux, forms, performance, batching, concurrent rendering, and common interview questions with answers.

Use these guides to review concepts, practice coding exercises, and prepare for technical interviews.

- **React Practice Exercises (in `src/` folder)**
  - The `src/Components/` directory contains practical React exercises and components for hands-on learning:
    - `Greeting.tsx`: A component that displays a personalized greeting.
    - `Counter.tsx`: A counter component using React hooks.
    - `UserForm.tsx`: A controlled form for capturing user input.
    - `PostList.tsx`: Fetches and displays a list of posts from an API.
    - `UseToggle.tsx`: A custom hook for toggling boolean state.
  - The main app (`App.tsx`) brings these exercises together for interactive practice.

Use these components to practice implementing common React interview tasks and reinforce your understanding of React fundamentals.
